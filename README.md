For this assignment you are given the file SmartString.h that contains the sample code. The tasks you need to accomplish are:

<ul>

 <li>You will need to implement all the functions of the SmartString class exactly like they have been declared in the header file.</li>

 <li>You cannot change the access specifiers of either the attributes or the functions.</li>

 <li>You cannot add extra attributes to the class itself. The functions can have local variables.</li>

 <li>Try to use functions inside one another to maximize code reuse.</li>

 <li>You will need to define cpp and main.cpp</li>

 <li>All the functions of the SmartString class must work in the main file</li>

 <li>This is the last programming assignment, so do not forget to treat yourself once it is done!</li>

</ul>
